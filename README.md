# Picker 2.0

This is a quick random picker I created for our group deep dives.  
Fill the box with the names/topic to extract, one topic per line and click on the spin button to choose a random topic.  
  
In the "cheers" folder is possible to put other wav files to play once a topic got selected.  
  
In the "sentences.txt" you can personalised the phrases that will appear on top of the chosen topic.
  
There is also a timer to keep track of the time of a topic.  
At 3 minutes the numbers will become orange.  
At 1 minute the numbers will become red.  
  
It is also possible to change the sound of the time's up from the settings menu (gear icon).

#### LAUNCH  
If a Windows user, click on the picker.exe file to run the program.  
If on a different OS, start the picker.py file.  
  
On the cmd, type:

``pip install -r requirements.txt``  
  
The program make use of only one external library, so you could just type:

``pip install pyqt5`` on your command line if you don't have installed it yet.
